# IS314 - Audit Project

The three projects in this repository made up the bulk of the [IS314 - Advanced Business Programming](https://catalog.uwec.edu/courses/is/) course at the [University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu). The second and third projects were built upon prior work:

1. Initial WinForms prototype with no database connectivity
2. WinForms application with MySQL database connectivity
3. WinForms to ASP.Net WebForms migration with MySQL database connectivity
